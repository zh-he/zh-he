## Hi! ðŸ˜Š Welcome to my GitHub.
I'm currently a third-year Master's student at East China University of Science and Technology. I will be joining the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT) as a research assistant. I hold a Bachelor's degree from Xiangtan University, and I'm actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities in natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs).
